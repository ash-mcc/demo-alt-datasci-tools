# Demo some of the alternative software tools for data science

> Ash will give a 15 minute demo of some of the 'less used in data science' software tools that he's been using. For example: Clojure instead of Python, Clerk instead of Jupyter, DVC instead of run-all.sh.

// keep to demo-able stuff 
// - don't preach or try to convert! 
// - might be of interest to see slightly different tech 
// - not a side-by-side comparison



* JVM hosted (calling Java)
* clj calling Python
* clj calling R
* clj on JS/Node
* Clerk for literate programming, as a notebook in HTML, as tap output
* DVC experiment tracking, reproducibility, data and code
